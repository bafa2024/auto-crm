# Campaign Edit Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive campaign edit functionality for the ACRM email campaign system, allowing users to modify existing campaigns before they are sent.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Service Methods (`services/EmailCampaignService.php`)
- **`getCampaignById($campaignId)`**: Retrieves campaign data by ID for editing
- **`editCampaign($campaignId, $campaignData)`**: Updates existing campaign with new data
- **`deleteCampaign($campaignId)`**: Deletes campaigns (bonus feature)
- **Validation**: Prevents editing of sent/completed campaigns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation

### 2. Frontend UI Components (`campaigns.php`)
- **Edit Button**: Added to each campaign card with pencil icon
- **Edit Modal**: Full-featured modal with all campaign fields
- **Form Fields**: 
  - Campaign name, subject, content
  - Sender name and email
  - Schedule type (immediate/scheduled/recurring)
  - Schedule date and frequency
  - Campaign status
- **Dynamic Schedule Options**: Show/hide based on schedule type selection

### 3. API Endpoint (`api/get_campaign.php`)
- **RESTful API**: Returns campaign data in JSON format
- **Security**: Session-based authentication
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Data Format**: Structured JSON response for frontend consumption

### 4. JavaScript Functionality
- **AJAX Loading**: Fetches campaign data via API
- **Form Population**: Automatically fills edit form with existing data
- **Date Handling**: Converts database dates to HTML datetime-local format
- **Dynamic UI**: Shows/hides schedule options based on selection

### 5. Database Schema Fixes
- **Missing Columns**: Added `schedule_type`, `schedule_date`, `frequency` columns
