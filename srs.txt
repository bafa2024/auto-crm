We need a dialer system where we can either upload a large Excel file or connect it directly with our CRM. The system should be able to handle simultaneous calling, for example, if 10 or 15 agents are working, it should be able to dial calls on a large scale, and as soon as someone picks up, the call should be automatically connected to a live agent. It should support both outgoing and incoming calls. There should also be an option to manually dial a single outgoing call if needed. The system should have a search bar to look up data quickly. There should be a form where we can enter and save the details of interested customers. It should include a pipeline and follow-up system, and be capable of dialing 20, 30, 40, or even 50 calls at once, because in the USA, most calls go to voicemail, so when there are more agents, we can increase the dialing speed to make sure agents get connected to live customers.

We also need an AI agent that we can train according to our needs. When an outgoing call is made, the AI should be able to automatically detect whether it's a voicemail or a live customer. If it’s a customer, the AI should be able to speak with them directly and collect all the necessary information. It should support multiple languages and have multiple voice options (both male and female). We should be able to choose the voice we want to use. We should be able to create as many AI agents as needed at any time, with no limitation. It should allow us to train the AI for different processes, and we should be able to customize the speaking speed, pitch, tone, etc. There should also be a call recording feature. You already understand the requirements well, so you know what other important features should be included.
