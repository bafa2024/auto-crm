Goal: Build a Power Dialer System You want to offer agents an alternative to predictive dialers — a Power Dialer — that: Allows manual list upload (100 to 2000 numbers). Uses a subscription-based VoIP service like Vonage or Zoom. Dials numbers one by one automatically after clicking "Start". Works over existing subscription plans (i.e., no need to pay per call or use expensive predictive dialing solutions). ✅ Core Features to Implement List Upload: Agents upload a .csv or .xlsx file with phone numbers. Validate numbers before starting the dialer. Dialer Interface: "Start Dialing" button triggers automatic sequential calls. Display: Current call status (e.g., “Calling X...”, “Connected”, “No Answer”). Option to skip, hang up, or pause. Real-time logging of each attempt. Call Connection: Calls made using your Vonage or Zoom subscription (VoIP). Integration via API or SDK. Auto-initiate calls via softphone, webphone, or browser SDK. Call Handling: After each call ends (or is skipped), the system waits 1–2 seconds then starts dialing the next. Log call outcomes. Settings (Optional but Helpful): Call delay between numbers. Retry logic for failed numbers. Notes after each call.

One little thing that you need to update in this... Power dailer. It's mean when any person or any agent don't want to work on predictive dailer... Then there need to be a system. That single agent or person can login, or we can allow him that yes he can login and after that he can upload a list of list can be uploaded through crm . Or one by one call can be dail... Wait let me explain you in details


We need a dialer system where we can either upload a large Excel file or connect it directly with our CRM. The system should be able to handle simultaneous calling, for example, if 10 or 15 agents are working, it should be able to dial calls on a large scale, and as soon as someone picks up, the call should be automatically connected to a live agent. It should support both outgoing and incoming calls. There should also be an option to manually dial a single outgoing call if needed. The system should have a search bar to look up data quickly. There should be a form where we can enter and save the details of interested customers. It should include a pipeline and follow-up system, and be capable of dialing 20, 30, 40, or even 50 calls at once, because in the USA, most calls go to voicemail, so when there are more agents, we can increase the dialing speed to make sure agents get connected to live customers.

We also need an AI agent that we can train according to our needs. When an outgoing call is made, the AI should be able to automatically detect whether it's a voicemail or a live customer. If it’s a customer, the AI should be able to speak with them directly and collect all the necessary information. It should support multiple languages and have multiple voice options (both male and female). We should be able to choose the voice we want to use. We should be able to create as many AI agents as needed at any time, with no limitation. It should allow us to train the AI for different processes, and we should be able to customize the speaking speed, pitch, tone, etc. There should also be a call recording feature. You already understand the requirements well, so you know what other important features should be included.
